This is a simple script to plot the dynamical structure factor using Phonopy force_sets/force_constants

The calculation of dynamical structure factor is as same as Phonopy website:
http://phonopy.github.io/phonopy/dynamic-structure-factor.html

If BORN file is within the same folder, it seems it can include LO-TO splitting automatically. But I need to double-check
